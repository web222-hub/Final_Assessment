        <h3>Concept of Responsive Design</h3>
        <p>Responsive design is a web design method that allows your content to adjust to various screen and window sizes on a range of devices. Software developers may use responsive design to create a Web page that adapts to the size of the devices it is displayed on. This approach to development allows Web pages to be rendered quickly and efficiently, resulting in a positive user experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop platforms.</p>


        <h3>How responsive design relate to web technologies</h3>
       
        <p>Responsive design entails: I adapting the page layout to the device's resolution; (ii) automatically resizing images to fit on the screen; hiding unnecessary elements in smaller devices; (iii) adapting the size of buttons and links to touch interfaces where the mouse pointer is replaced by the user's finger; and (iv) utilizing intelligent features in mobile devices, such as geo-localization and changing the orientation of the content view.</p>
        <p>There are a number of benefits to using a responsive design strategy. According to Lestari et al. (2014), responsive web design is a good way to improve user experiences.According to Majid et al. (2015), responsive design is a versatile strategy that may be utilized to construct e-commerce solutions that increase SEO. According to Rashid (2017), there are five primary reasons for responsive design's rapid growth: I increasing mobile traffic; (ii) cheaper cost and website upkeep; (iii) gives a seamless user experience; (iv) adjusts quickly to any screen size; and (v) boosts SEO efforts.</p>

        <h3>Building web apps for different devices</h3>
        <p>Because a website constantly adjusts to the width of the device in which it is being viewed, responsive design arises as a technical solution that mitigates this issue. According to Subic et al. (2014), a website's content should intelligently re-shape itself for optimum usability and effect. In this method, a website's HTML and CSS code adapts to the device's resolution without the need to establish various styles. Three technological components make up responsible web design (Cazaas & Parra, 2017): I fluid grids, (ii) flexible images, and (iii) media queries. Fluid grids are in charge of assigning relative units to page components; flexible pictures are likewise scaled in relative units; and media queries enable switching between different CSS styles depending on the device's characteristics.</p>

        <h3>Learning Experience</h3>


        <p>I learned how to write custom CSS and HTML to adapt the website to different screen widths. With the amount of mobile and tablet web traffic growing by leaps and bounds every day, I need to know how to establish breakpoints and unique CSS layouts so that my designs can adapt to different device resolutions. I've also learned how to create external style sheets for three distinct resolutions, as well as how to alter layouts for each.I've also learned how to make responsive navigation and visuals, as well as text and other layout elements. I feel great having learnt this important concepts</p>
